# Genki Companion

*Hosted version available at [https://genki.noahc3.tk](https://genki.noahc3.ml).*

Genki Companion is a website build with ReactJS to help you learn and study Japanese vocabulary, kanji, and conjugation rules alongside the GENKI 1 3rd edition textbook.

The website does not aim to *teach* you these concepts, just help you study them, thus this website is best used alongside a course or a rigid self-study routine which follows the GENKI textbook.

This website includes all vocabulary and Kanji as well as most of the important conjugation rules from lessions 1-9 of the GENKI 1 3rd edition textbook.

## Code Quality Disclaimer

**This code should be treated as a high-fidelity prototype with a little bit of extra polish to make it not-too-frustrating to use.**

I created this project primarily to aid me in learning Japanese in my intro course, but also as my first foray into JS-based web development and React. This project was started having less than four hours of prior React experience, so the code quality is *abysmal*. Some notable problems:

- Lots of copy pasted React componenets, which could be joined into a generalized component and customized with props.
- Horrible landing page code and game start logic.
- Generally difficult to follow and poorly organized code.
- So much duplicate code *everywhere*.

If I were to continue active development on this project, I would probably go ahead and fix these issues. However, my Japanese course is ending the week I'm making this public, so I don't know if I'll continue maintaining this. Therefore, at least as of now, this horrible-but-functional code is provided as-is. I will only make updates if any of the content in the games are explicitly wrong.
